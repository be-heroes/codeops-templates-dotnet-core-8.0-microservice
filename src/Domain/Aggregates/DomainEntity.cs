///     The Aggregate Root is a design pattern that's used in Domain-Driven Design (DDD). It's a part of the tactical
///     design patterns set which also includes Entities, Value Objects, and Domain Events.
///     An Aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. An example may be an Order and
///     its line-items, these will be separate objects, but it's useful to treat the Order (along with its line items) as a
///     single aggregate.
///     An Aggregate Root is the object or entity that holds the aggregate together. It's the gatekeeper to the aggregate
///     and all interactions with the aggregate should go through the Aggregate Root. In the previous example, the Order
///     would be the Aggregate Root.
///     The Aggregate Root has the following responsibilities:
///     Ensures the consistency of changes being made within the aggregate boundary: The Aggregate Root is responsible for
///     checking the validity of the operation before it changes the state of the aggregate.
///     Controls access to the aggregate: The Aggregate Root is the only point of access for other objects. This means that
///     other objects can't directly access the contained entities or value objects.
///     Maintains the lifecycle of the aggregate: The Aggregate Root is responsible for the creation and deletion of the
///     aggregate.
///     In your code, DomainEntity is an Aggregate Root as it implements the IAggregateRoot interface. This means that
///     DomainEntity is the entry point for any operations that involve the aggregate it's part of.
